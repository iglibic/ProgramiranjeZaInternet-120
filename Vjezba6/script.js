 * It has to have a class method called getDetails that returns
 * a sentence (string) that describes the book (what is the title, who is the author and what year was it published).
 * To create that string use string literals (not concatenation).
 * Create an instance of that class for a book called "The Fellowship of the Ring" by J.R.R. Tolkien that was published 1954
 * Log the result of calling the getDetails method on that instance

 * It should also have a method called "download" which prints the following sentence:
 * Downloading 'title' in 'fileFormat' format. Link: 'downloadLink'
 * Where the values in parentheses are switched with the true values of the class properties using string literals.
 * Create an instance of the EBook class for a book called 'The Two Towers' by J.R.R. Tolkien that was published in 1954 in mp3 format
